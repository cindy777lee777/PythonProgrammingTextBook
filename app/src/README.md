# Python Development
*🎉🎈🎂🍾🎊🍻💃*

*A hands on and practical introduction
 to programming and python development.*

The purpose of this course is to introduce some fundamental concepts of software development. We will be using the python programming language, which provides a readable, powerful syntax that is used by data scientists, web developers, even NASA engineers! In particular, our aspiration in this workshop is to work up to a point where we can confidently and feasibly level up our python knowledge without external support from anyone.
