# Gutenberg


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mottaquikarim/gutenberg.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mottaquikarim/gutenberg)


A wrapper around the fantastic **[mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook)** project that generates markdown based documentation content.

This repo is meant to be used as a harness to build and deploy gitbook like documentation for teaching. It uses **[travis](https://travis-ci.org/)** to build and serve the content artifact and node js to generate summary content for an easy, automated book table of contents building process.

Makefile is used to handle task runner functions.
