* Handling missing data in both floating point and non-floating point data sets
* Merging & joining datasets
* Reshaping and pivoting datasets
* Conditional data sorting and filtering
* Iterating through data sets
* Aggregating and transforming data sets with split-apply-combine operations from the group by engine
* Automatic and explicit aligning and manipulating of high-dimensional data structures via hierarchical labeling and axis indexing
