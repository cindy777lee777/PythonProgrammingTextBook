# Pandas Data Manipulation

## Our Wine Reviews Dataset

Let's start our interactive lesson on data manipulation with Pandas by first reacquainting ourselves with our practice dataset: [Wine Reviews | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/).

*This dataset holds 130k wine reviews with variety, location, winery, price, & description.* Here's the `data dictionary` provided by the dataset's creator.

* `country`: The country that the wine is from
* `description`: Brief qualitative description by taster.
* `designation`: The vineyard within the winery where the grapes that made the wine are from
* `points`: The number of points WineEnthusiast rated the wine on a scale of 1-100 (though they say they only post reviews for wines that score >=80)
* `price`: The cost for a bottle of the wine
* `province`: The province or state that the wine is from
* `region_1`: The wine growing area in a province or state (ie Napa)
* `region_2`: Sometimes there are more specific regions specified within a wine growing area (ie Rutherford inside the Napa Valley), but this value can sometimes be blank
* `taster_name`: 
* `taster_twitter_handle`: 
* `title`: The title of the wine review, which often contains the vintage if you're interested in extracting that feature
* `variety`: The type of grapes used to make the wine (ie Pinot Noir)
* `winery`: The winery that made the wine
