## The What, Why, & Who of Data Science

Whether or not they realize, most people have come into contact with data science in their daily lives. We've seen trending articles on digital news outlets, personalized product recommendations from online stores, and advertisments that seemingly hear our every thought and conversation. But what exactly *is* data science?

#### WHAT
* Acquiring, organizing, and delivering complex data
* Building and deploying machine learning models
* Conducting statistical analyses, including ANOVA, linear models, regression analysis, and hypothesis tests
* Visualizing data distributions, hierarchical clustering, histograms, pie and bar charts, etc.

#### WHY
* Identify hidden patterns, correlations, and outliers to glean meaningful insights.
* Based on these insights, validate assumptions, make predictions, define optimizations, and most importantly make strategic decisions.

#### WHO
Professionals who practice data science for businesses, government institutions, nonprofits, and other organizations might have one of these titles:
* **Machine Learning Engineer**:
	* Work in production code.
	* Identify machine learning applications.
	* Manage infrastructure and data pipelines
	* “Straddle the line between knowing the mathematics and coding the mathematics.” - eBay VP of engineering Japjit Tulsi
* **Data Engineer**:
	* Create an architecture that facilitates data acquisition and machine learning problems at scale.
	* Focus on the algorithm and the analysis rather than the software.
* **Research Science**:
	* Specialized research scientist focused on driving scientific discovery rather than pursuing industrial applications.
	* Backgrounds in both data science and computer science.
	* Determines new algorithmic optimizations, especially in the realm of AI.
* **Advanced Analyst**:
	* Apply descriptive and inferential exploratory data analysis and modeling.


Effective data science lives at the intersection of...

That's pretty broad though. What skills in each of these areas are needed for data science specifically? A good data scientist:

* **MATHEMATICS**: Understands statistical concepts and modeling; proficient in R and/or Python
* **COMPUTER SCIENCE**: Has experience in data engineering (i.e. organizing data, running models, visualizing results, etc.); proficient in R and/or Python
* **DOMAIN EXPERTISE**: Understands the business and social context of issue and can ask questions that lead to appropriate approaches and insights
